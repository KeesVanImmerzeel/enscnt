For the constructing of this package, a fraction of the source data is randomly selected
with the script:

'data-raw/sampling.r'

as the original files would be too large to be uploaded on GitHub.
The lines in the resulting file in data-raw/en_ne.txt' are cleaned with the function clean_text()
(as included in this package) and made available as the dataset "en_ne_sentences".

To show the first sentence of the dataset:
